"As of 0.4.1, `rsetup` can be used to create stress test images. This "
"functionality relies on proper `gpiod` pin definition, as well as correct "
"GPIO LEDs device tree definition, both are part of the system release "
"requirements. As such, this can be used as a unified method to create stress "
"test images."

"The factory stress test procedure begins with the pin connected, which is "
"recognized by `factory_stress` as a signal to start the stress test, and "
"update LEDs' pattern. The QA engineer will then disconnect the wire once the "
"LED pattern indicates the test is started. This way, if the device fails the "
"stress test and is rebooted, `factory_stress` will not be started again due "
"to the GPIO value does not match the specified value."
